## Overview

The Azure Key Vault Universal Orchestrator extension enables seamless integration between Keyfactor Command and Microsoft Azure Key Vault. This extension facilitates remote management of cryptographic certificates stored in Azure Key Vault, ensuring organizational security and compliance requirements are met. With this extension, users can manage certificates remotely by performing various operations such as inventory, addition, removal, and discovery of certificates and certificate stores.

Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that provides secure storage for secrets, including cryptographic keys and certificates. Certificates in Azure Key Vault are utilized to secure communications and safeguard data by managing the associated cryptographic keys and policies.

Defined Certificate Stores of the Certificate Store Type in Keyfactor Command represent the individual or grouped certificates managed within a specific remote location, such as Azure Key Vault. Each Certificate Store is configured to interface with an Azure Key Vault instance, allowing the orchestrator to perform the required certificate management operations.
